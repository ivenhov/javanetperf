javanetperf
===========

A convenient copy for evolution of Evan Jones's set of experiments to be found
here http://www.evanjones.ca/software/javanetperf.tar.bz2. Please note the original
had a JUnit 4.7 jar packed with it under a lib folder.
To get started have a play with the different experiments in the default package
and read up on the aim of the excercise in Mr. Jones's blog here: http://www.evanjones.ca
and about the later additions here: http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.co.uk/
