javanetperf
===========

A convenient copy for evolution of Evan Jones's set of experiments to be found
here http://www.evanjones.ca/software/javanetperf.tar.bz2. Please note the original
had a JUnit 4.7 jar packed with it under a lib folder.
To get started have a play with the different experiments in the default package
and read up on the aim of the exercise in Mr. Jones's blog here: http://www.evanjones.ca
and about the later additions here: http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.co.uk/ 
This branch is where further changes to the original source by Evan Jones original
will be gathered until such time he jumps in and approves :). If you want the original
check out the master branch.
